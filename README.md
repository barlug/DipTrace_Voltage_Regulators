# DipTrace_Voltage_Regulators

##### There are two types of DipTrace Voltage Regulator circuit Heirarchy Blocks in this Repo:

## 1) Adjustable Linear Voltage Regulator 
intended for use as positive adjustable voltage regulators. They are designed to supply more than 1.5 A of load current with an output voltage adjustable over a 1.2 to 37 V range. The nominal output voltage is selected by means of a resistive divider, making the device exceptionally easy to use and eliminating the stocking of many fixed regulators.

- **Part:** LM317T
- **Line regulation Voltage Range (Vin - Vout):**  3V - 40V 
- **Output Voltage Range:** 1.2V - 37V
- **Reference Voltage Between Pins 3 (Vout) and 1 (Vin):** 1.25 V
- **Output Current:** 1.5+ A

## 2) Constant Linear Voltage Regulator
Typical Application for L78L08AC Positive Voltage Regulator for Output boost circuit. The L78L series of three-terminal positive regulators employ internal current limiting and thermal shutdown, making them essentially indestructible. If adequate heat-sink is provided, they can deliver up to 100 mA output current. They are intended as fixed voltage regulators in a wide range of applications including local or on-card regulation for elimination of noise and distribution problems associated with single-point regulation

- **Part:** L78L08AC
- **Line regulation Voltage Range (Vin - Vout):**  3V - 40V 
- **Output Voltage:** Vout = Vz + Vx (Zener Voltage + Voltage across Resistor)
- **Reference Voltage Between Pins 3 (Vout) and 1 (Vin):** 1.25 V
- **Output Current:** 1.5+ A
